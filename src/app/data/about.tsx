    `My name is Vineet Agarwal. My work combines Data Science and 
Web Technology to create functional, reliable and beautiful websites and visualizations.

    `The first bit of code I wrote was a mockup of Iron-Man’s J.A.R.V.I.S. way back in 2014. It didn’t
do much - just wished Good Morning when prompted but that’s where it all started!
`,
    `I ventured into Data Science and started enjoying it. But I also felt that this did not satisfy my
creative mind. This made me dive into visualization principles to understand how to make my line graphs 
prettier (I’m dead serious...). My journey took  me somewhat further down the rabbit hole than I had 
intended and though I dirtied my fluffy white tail, I emerged enlightened (Yes, I am a Sherlock fan). 
Thereafter, I started learning about Web Technology and have been working to create visually appealing 
websites and visualizations.
